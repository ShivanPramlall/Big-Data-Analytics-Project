Main Objective: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing, Regression, Classification, and Clustering using R in real-world scenarios.


PART 1: Student Performance Analysis

• Objective: Analyze high school students' last-term results to identify factors influencing grades.

• Data Preparation: Handled missing values, removed duplicates.

• Exploratory Data Analysis: Evaluated and visualized the various factors that may influence student grades.

• Statistical Testing: Applied ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test to assess the impact of different factors on student performance.


PART 2: Car Price Prediction

• Objective: Build a machine learning model to improve car pricing efficiency.
• Data Preparation: Handled missing values, removed outliers and duplicates, dropped unnecessary columns.
• Modelling and Forecasting:
  - Implemented Multiple Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression models.
    o Fitted and evaluated using coefficient of determination and RMSE.
    o Visualized the line of best fit of the different machine learning models used for car price prediction.


PART 3: Forest Type Classification in Japan

• Objective: Develop a model to classify different forest types in Japan.
• Data Preparation: Handled missing values, removed outliers and duplicates.
• Modelling and Classification:
  - Logistic regression, a Naïve Bayes model, and a Decision Tree Models
    o Fitted and evaluated using coefficient of determination and RMSE.
    o Computed the confusion matrices and classification accuracy for the three models on both the training and test set.
  - Applied K-Means Clustering to distinguish forest types, determining optimal clusters with the elbow method and visualizing Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS).
