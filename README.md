Main Objective: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Regression analysis, Classification and Clustering in real-world scenarios within the R ecosystem

PART 1

•  Objective: Conducting a comprehensive analysis of high school student’s last term results to evaluate the various factors that may influence student grades.
•  Data Preparation: Handled missing values, removed duplicates.
•  Exploratory Data Analysis: Evaluated and visualized the various factors that may influence student grades.
•  ANOVA Testing Tukey’s HSD test: Using ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test to determine whether various factors had an impact of the students’ performance.

PART 2

•  Objective: Building a machine learning model to enhance the efficiency of car pricing process.
•  Data Preparation: Handled missing values, removed outliers and duplicates, dropped unnecessary columns.
•  Modelling and Forecasting:
-	Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tress Regression Models: Fitted and evaluated using coefficient of determination and RMSE.
o	Visualized the line of best fit of different machine learning models used for car price prediction.

PART 3

•  Objective: Building a machine learning model to classify different forest types in Japan.
•  Data Preparation: Handled missing values, removed outliers and duplicates.
•  Model: Evaluated and visualized the line of best fit, of different machine learning models used for car price prediction.
•  Modelling and Classification:
-	Logistic regression, a Naïve Bayes model, and a Decision Tree Models: Fitted and evaluated using coefficient of determination and RMSE.
o	Computed the confusion matrices and classification accuracy for the three models on both the training and test set
-	K-Means clustering: Using k-Means clustering distinguish the different types of forest with the Japanese landscape.
o	Using the elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters, and provided Within Cluster Sum of Squares line graph
